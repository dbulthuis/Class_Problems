But, my advice, stick it out here like you are doing; this is a fantastically taught class. </p>

867114:<p>I guess my point is I hope to see more content that is driven on the connections between languages, and respectively, I hope to see full-fledged courses based on those said languages, i.e., JavaScript course, C++, OCaml, etc.  Building on what we know in Python is a fantastically seamless transition and is comforting considering how alien some of these concepts might seem.</p>
